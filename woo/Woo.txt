How to find WooCommerce products in the database
Let’s show how to find products that you need and look at the relevant tables which contain your product data.

In newer WooCommerce (since 3.7+) versions are products stored in the following tables (mainly the first two): 

wp_posts 
(table with a post_type product or product_variation)
wp_postmeta 
(table with a post_id as the relational index) (the product ID)
wp_wc_product_meta_lookup 
(table – product_id as the relational index) (the post ID) | Allow fast queries on specific product data
wp_wc_order_product_lookuptable – product_id as the relational index (the post ID) | Allow fast queries to retrieve products on orders

SQL query on table wordpress.wp_posts:
	
SELECT * FROM `wp_posts` WHERE `post_type` LIKE 'product'
phpMyAdmin – search post_type

Product categories, subcategories, tags, attributes, or custom taxonomies are stored in the following tables (some additional plugins got their own tables):

    wp_terms
    wp_termmeta
    wp_term_taxonomy
    wp_term_relationships – column object_id as the relational index (the product ID)
    wp_woocommerce_termmeta
    wp_woocommerce_attribute_taxonomies (for product attributes only)
    wp_wc_category_lookup (for product categories hierarchy – since WooCommerce 3.7)

In fact, products are stored only as another post type. They can be found in the wp_posts table, under the product post type.

When you find the product that you need, copy its id and easily lookup for the remaining information under other tables.
