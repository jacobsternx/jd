MySQL is a popular RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). MariaDB was born as a fork of MySQL. Nowadays the two products are a little bit different. Migrating data from one system to the other could not be a trivial task.
MariaDB is fully GPLv2 licensed while MySQL has two licensing options, GPLv2 (for the Community edition) and Enterprise.
In the Fedora repositories you can find:
    MariaDB 10.3 (as a regular package or as a module)
    MariaDB 10.4 (as a module)
    MySQL 8.0 community edition (as a regular package or as a module)
    MariaDB and MySQL packages conflict each other. You have to install MariaDB or MySQL.
    In addition you can install MySQL commmunity edition (8.0 or 5.7) from the repository maintained by MySQL itself: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/yum/

:: To install mariadb server ::

sudo dnf module install mariadb/server
With modules, you could also install a specific profile: like client, devel or galera (the multi-master replica). For instance, if you donâ€™t want to install the server stuff, but only the client packages:
sudo dnf module install mariadb:10.6/client
    MariaDB default root password is empty.
    find Default Password, For security reasons, MySQL generates a temporary root key. Please
sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

Configuring SQL before the first use
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Some questions will be asked: answer to them as you prefer; answering yes to all of them is perfectly fine.

Using SQL
sudo mysql -u root -p

Removing SQL
I suggest to remove in the following way:
sudo dnf remove mariadb-server

:: Install from Podman ::

:: My Notes ::
/var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
#
sudo journalctl -xeu mariadb.service
Database MariaDB is probably initialized in /var/lib/mysql already, nothing is done.
If this is not the case, make sure the /var/lib/mysql is empty before running mariadb-prepare-db-dir.

mariadb.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=2/INVALIDARGUMENT
#
sudo dnf module enable mariadb:10.6
It is not possible to switch enabled streams of a module unless explicitly enabled via configuration option module_stream_switch.
It is recommended to rather remove all installed content from the module, and reset the module using 'dnf module reset <module_name>' command. After you reset the module, you can install the other stream.
#
Most commonly errors that do not disappear after a reinstallation mean that your data directory (by default /var/lib/mysql/) is corrupted and the database needs to be reinstalled with mysql_install_db. To make sure you do a clean installation, remove all files located in the data directory and then run sudo mysql_install_db --user=mysql.

I solved as follows:
After installing
Run: > mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/
Then: > mysql_secure_installation
And then: systemctl start mariadb

:: Change password ::
SET PASSWORD FOR 'jacob'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('a');
