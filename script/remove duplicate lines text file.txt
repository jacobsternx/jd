Removing duplicate lines from a text file using Linux command line
17 May 2021 by Luke Reynolds

Removing duplicate lines from a text file can be done from the Linux command line. Such a task may be more common and necessary than you think. The most common scenario where this can be helpful is with log files. Oftentimes log files will repeat the same information over and over, which makes the file nearly impossible to sift through, sometimes rendering the logs useless.

In this guide, we’ll show various command line examples that you can use to delete duplicate lines from a text file. Try out some of the commands on your own system, and use whichever one is most convenient for your scenario.

In this tutorial you will learn:

    How to remove duplicate lines from file when sorting
    How to count the number of duplicate lines in a file
    How to remove duplicate lines without sorting the file

Remove duplicate lines from text file

 

These examples will work on any Linux distribution, provided that you are using the Bash shell.

For our example scenario, we’ll be working with the following file, which just contains the names of various Linux distributions. This is a very simple text file for the sake of example, but in reality you could use these methods on documents that contain even thousands of repeat lines. We’ll see how to remove all the duplicates from this file using the examples below.

$ cat distros.txt
Ubuntu
CentOS
Debian
Ubuntu
Fedora
Debian
openSUSE
openSUSE
Debian

Example 1
    The uniq command is able to isolate all of the unique lines from our file, but this only works if the duplicate lines are adjacent to each other. In order for the lines to be adjacent, they would first need to be sorted into alphabetical order. The following command would work by using sort and uniq.

    $ sort distros.txt | uniq
    CentOS
    Debian
    Fedora
    openSUSE
    Ubuntu

    To make things easier, we can just use the -u with sort to get the same exact result, instead of piping to uniq.
     

    $ sort -u distros.txt
    CentOS
    Debian
    Fedora
    openSUSE
    Ubuntu

Example 2
    To see how many occurrences of each line is in the file, we can use the -c (count) option with uniq.

    $ sort distros.txt | uniq -c
          1 CentOS
          3 Debian
          1 Fedora
          2 openSUSE
          2 Ubuntu

Example 3
    To see the lines that repeat most often, we can pipe to yet another sort command with the -n (numeric sort) and -r reverse options. This allows us to quickly see which lines are most duplicated in the file – another handy option for sifting through logs.

    $ sort distros.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr
          3 Debian
          2 Ubuntu
          2 openSUSE
          1 Fedora
          1 CentOS


Example 4     
    One problem with using the previous commands is that we rely on sort. This means that our final output is alphabetically sorted, or sorted by amount of repeats as in the previous example. This may be a good thing sometimes, but what if we need the text file to retain its previous order? We can eliminate duplicate lines without sorting the file by using the awk command in the following syntax.

    $ awk '!seen[$0]++' distros.txt 
    Ubuntu
    CentOS
    Debian
    Fedora
    openSUSE

    With this command, the first occurrence of a line is kept, and future duplicate lines are scrapped from the output.

Example 5
    The previous examples will send output directly to your terminal. If you want a new text file with your duplicate lines filtered out, you can adapt any of these examples by simply using the > bash operator like in the following command.

    $ awk '!seen[$0]++' distros.txt > distros-new.txt

These should be all the commands you need in order to drop duplicate lines from a file, while optionally sorting or counting the lines. More methods do exist, but these are the easiest to use and remember.
