The additional repositories can also be managed using a terminal and DNF.
$ wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm
$ sudo dnf localinstall ./google-chrome-stable_current_x86_64.rpm

Installing Chrome will also add the repository to your package manager. Use the following command to keep Chrome up to date on your system.
$ sudo dnf install google-chrome-stable

If you decide that you’d like to remove Chrome from your system in the future, use the following command to uninstall the web browser.
$ sudo dnf remove google-chrome-stable

:: CLI Installing Chrome
Fedora now comes with the Google Chrome repository. But, the repository is disabled by default. So, you will need to enable the Google Chrome repository to install it on your system.
$ sudo sed -i 's/enabled=0/enabled=1/' /etc/yum.repos.d/google-chrome.repo
Install Google Chrome on Fedora 35
$ sudo dnf install -y google-chrome-stable
