Communicating effectively and consistently across different platforms, audiences and contexts means defining and refining your brand’s tone and voice: the two aspects of the way you express yourself in social media communication. 

Voice: The overall personality and style of your posts, which should be aligned with your brand identity and values. For instance, brands can be lively, positive, cynical or professional.

Tone: A subset of your brand’s voice. Tone adds specific emotion to your voice based on factors like audience, situation and channel. For example, your voice may be friendly, professional or humorous, while your tone may be formal, casual or enthusiastic.

In a nutshell, there is only one voice for your brand and many tones that refine it. Here are some key steps to help you define and maintain your voice and tone on social media. 
Conduct a voice and tone audit

Analyze your existing social media posts and evaluate how they reflect your brand identity and values, how they resonate with your audience and how they fit the different platforms and purposes. 

Make sure you identify what works well and what needs improvement, and look for inconsistencies in your voice and tone across different channels. You can also benchmark your voice and tone against your competitors and industry leaders and see how you can differentiate yourself and stand out.
Develop a voice and tone guide

Based on your audit, create a document that defines your voice and tone for social media and provides guidelines and examples for applying them in different scenarios. Your voice and tone guide should include the following elements:

    Your voice attributes: Describe the personality and style of your voice. For example, you may choose to describe your voice as friendly, professional and informative.
    Your tone variations: Explain how you adjust your tone depending on the platform, audience, purpose and context of your message. You may use a more formal and informative tone on LinkedIn and a more casual and humorous tone on Twitter, while maintaining your friendly and professional voice.
    Your dos and don'ts: Provide some best practices and tips for using your voice and tone in social media. For example, you may advise to use abbreviations and emojis sparingly, to avoid jargon and slang, to proofread your posts and to avoid controversial or sensitive topics.
    Implement and monitor your voice and tone: Once you have your voice and tone guide, share it with your social media team and use it as a reference for creating and reviewing your posts. Measure the impact and effectiveness of your voice and tone by using metrics such as likes, shares, comments, engagement, reach and conversion. 

Be clear and concise

Your voice and tone should be easy to understand and follow. Use simple and direct language and avoid jargon, acronyms or complex sentences. 

You should also choose the optimal length and format for your message, while avoiding unnecessary or redundant information. For example, you may use bullet points or quotes to highlight your main points and images, videos or links to support your message.
Be respectful and responsible

Avoid offending or alienating your audience. Your voice and tone should always be respectful and courteous to your followers. Take accountability for your message and avoid making false or misleading claims.

Make sure you acknowledge your audience's feedback or criticism, and apologize and correct any mistakes.
