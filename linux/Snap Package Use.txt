Snap Package Use

    A .snap package for the Ubuntu Core system contains all its dependencies. This has a couple of advantages over traditional deb or rpm based dependency handling, the most important being that a developer can always be assured that there are no regressions triggered by changes to the system underneath their app.

1. Finding Snap packages to install
snap find <search_text>

2. Install Snap packages
sudo snap install <package>

3. Keep track of Snap packages
snap list
3.1 History of the changes made to your system with Snap.
snap changes

4. Upgrade and downgrade Snap packages
Snap packages normally checks for updates four times a day and then installs automatically. To force update
sudo snap refresh <package>
4.1. To see which Snap packages have updates ready to be installed
sudo snap refresh --list
4.2. If wish to revert to the previously installed version
sudo snap revert <package>

5. Remove Snap packages
sudo snap remove <package>
Uninstall a Snap package
Remove Snap packages

6. Changing channels to switch between beta, release candidate and daily build version. By default, Snap packages are installed from the ‘stable’ channel.
    stable: The latest stable release of an application
    candidate: The release candidate (RC) of an application 
    beta: Unstable version that has reached a certain milestone
    edge: Daily/nightly build of an application under development
sudo snap refresh <package> --channel=<channel_name>
You can switch back to the old channel either by using the refresh command as shown above or simply use the revert command shown in section four.

7. Install Snap apps offline
snap download <package_name>
This will download a .assert and a .snap file. You can copy these files to the other Linux system which is not connected to the internet. And then you can install it using the command:

snap ack <package_name.assert>
snap install <package_name.snap>

May need to “snap download” the “core” snap and if needed a content snap such as “gnome-3-26-1604” which are needed by some of the GNOME snaps.
