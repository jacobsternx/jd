1. In this guide, we will look at how to Install and Configure phpMyAdmin on Fedora 35. PHPMyAdmin is an open source software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web interface.

phpMyAdmin has support for a wide range of operations on MySQL, MariaDB, and Drizzle. It is often used to perform common Database operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) through an intuitive and easy to use web interface.

Follow the steps below to Install phpMyAdmin on Fedora35.
Step 1: Install Apache HTTP Server and PHP

Apache HTTP server and PHP are required dependencies for phpMyAdmin. Install them first :

sudo dnf -y install httpd php php-cli php-php-gettext php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-mysqlnd php-pear php-curl php-gd php-xml php-bcmath php-zip

Configure httpd basic settings:

Edit the configuration file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and set:

ServerAdmin root@localhost
ServerName  localhost

:: Append this ::
# ServerTokens Major|Minor|Min|Prod|OS|Full
# The server will send the Web server’s name alone, which is recommended as 
# the hacker will not have a clue of which version of Apache is running in 
# the server and also which operating system is used. The information sent 
# will be “Server: Apache”. We would recommend using this option to avoid 
# unwanted exploitation of your server information.
ServerTokens Prod
#
# Optionally set Keepalive:
KeepAlive On

Enable and start httpd service:

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

If you have firewalld running, allow both http and https services:

sudo firewall-cmd --add-service={http,https} --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Confirm your installed PHP version:

$ php -v
PHP 8.0.17 (cli) (built: Mar 15 2022 08:24:20) ( NTS gcc x86_64 )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.0.17, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v8.0.17, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies

Loaded extensions can be viewed by passing -m option to the phpcommand

$ php -m

Set PHP timezone on the file /etc/php.ini

date.timezone = America/Phoenix

See a complete List of Supported Timezones.
