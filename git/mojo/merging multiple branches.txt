Merging multiple branches with git

$ git branch -a
* develop
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/feature1
  remotes/origin/feature2
  remotes/origin/master

How can I merge remotes/origin/feature1 and remotes/origin/feature2 into my local "master" branch, copy that all into "develop" and start working with actual code in my "develop" branch?


    git checkout master
    git pull origin feature1 feature2
    git checkout develop
    git pull . master (or maybe git rebase ./master)

The first command changes your current branch to master.

The second command pulls in changes from the remote feature1 and feature2 branches. This is an "octopus" merge because it merges more than 2 branches. You could also do two normal merges if you prefer.

The third command switches you back to your develop branch.

The fourth command pulls the changes from local master to develop.

Hope that helps.

EDIT: Note that git pull will automatically do a fetch so you don't need to do it manually. It's pretty much equivalent to git fetch followed by git merge.
