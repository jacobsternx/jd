[Link Text](https://www.example.com) "title attribute"
Note: Optionally, a tooltip can be added to a hyperlink with quotation marks when mouse hovering.

To denote a `word or phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

If ``Jacob`s word or  phrase`` you want to denote as code includes one or more backticks," you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double backticks (``; I'm only seeing this work if I double-backtick the whole phrase). 
Note: CR surrounds

``` code block ``` Code Block 
Note: CR surrounds
Note: Outside of code block, valid HTML \<p> must be escaped with backslash to be visible, as do lines beginning with \# 

Note: GitHub does not honor CSS color in readme.md files
